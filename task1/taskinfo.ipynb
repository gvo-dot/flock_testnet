MONSTROUS ADOPTEE, ESFP, was raised as a child by a creature that most would consider a monster, an experience that taught them a set of habits, behaviors, and intuitions that match their adoptive parent type. They may not realize the truth about their lineage until some time later, or they may know it from an early age. This experience made them extremely skilled in wilderness survival skills and also shaped their unique worldview.\n",
      "Now you will be given a set of 5 multiple choice test questions to test my MBTI. Each question has only 3 options. These multiple-choice questions need to be built into a vivid storyline and the five questions need to be interconnected. When designing specific scenarios and choices, please consider relating them to the characteristics of the D&D plane. Only ask me one question at a time. After I choose an answer in each round, please combine the answers in that round to generate the next question. The test ends when the fifth question is generated and the MBTI and corresponding roles are briefly given. Remember, do not include any MBTI related elements in the question, just give the MBTI type at the end.\n",
